# 🌱 @PolymerPatel
Systems Engineer | Aspiring Sustainability Analyst | Backend Developer <br>

## 🌍 Mission & Approach
I am seeking an Engineering position and have upskilled in data science and software development. <br><br>
Currently, I am building innovative material processes, utilizing data analytics tools and Engineering principles. <br><br>

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
♻️ Circular Economy: Electronic waste recovery, biomass, textiles, and life cycle analysis metrics<br>
🧪 Sustainable Materials: Research experience in casting processes and environmental contaminants like PFAS<br>
🐍 Backend Engineering: Python (Flask, Django), REST APIs, PostHog analytics, microservice architecture<br>
📊 Observability & Analytics: PostHog, Splunk, AppDynamics, metric visualization and user event tracking<br>
🗺️ Geospatial Data Tools: GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely, NumPy, Matplotlib<br>
📦 Startup Operations Systems: Workflow design, automation scoping, product metric roadmaps<br>

## 🚀 Current Projects

### 📈 Metrics System Design for [ToInfinity](https://www.toinfinfty.com) (March 2025 - Present)

#### Circular Fashion Tech Startup Roadmap

🛠️ Designed an end-to-end product analytics system for platform.<br>
⚙️ Operational Engineering system roadmap - life cycle assessment data integration and sustainability analytics.

#### Sustainability Metrics Dashboard in July 2025

- Continued design for an end-to-end product analytics system.<br>
- Translating customer procurement into dashboard KPIs <br>
- Developing UI, backend integration. <br>

📊 Metric dashboards for partner engagement and volunteer impact for current endeavor.<br>
🔁 KPI event funnel and PostHog setup during former client project<br>

#### 🧭 Critical Mineral Circularity Platform (March 2025 - Present)

Python GIS Sustainability Tool

- Merged carbon storage and e-waste analysis in a geospatial platform using Rasterio and GeoPandas.<br>
- Identified hotspots for battery material recovery, optimal collection routes, and infrastructure placement through geospatial overlays and NumPy statistics.

🔍 Carbon site screening based on raster metadata <br>
♻️ Electronic waste hotspot mapping and infrastructure siting <br>
🛠️ Future: Add Streamlit frontend for live web demo



## 🧭 Upskilling

🌐 Python GIS (Rasterio, GeoPandas, Dask)<br>
🔄 REST APIs & lightweight backends<br>
♻️ Circularity metrics in supply chains<br>
📌 PostHog + Streamlit dashboards<br>
🧰 Carbon capture and material lifecycle analysis


## 🫱 Let's Collaborate

I'm building an applied portfolio and always open to:

🌿 Sustainability analytics collaborations<br>
🗺️ GIS project contributions<br>
🧪 Materials circularity or reuse innovation<br>
